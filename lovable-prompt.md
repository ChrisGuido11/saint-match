### App Overview
Saint Match is a Catholic virtue-building app that matches you with a saint based on your current mood, then gives you a personalized micro-challenge inspired by that saint's life and virtues. Think of it as "Duolingo for becoming a better person" — daily, bite-sized actions that help you grow in patience, kindness, gratitude, and other virtues, guided by the wisdom of the Catholic saints.

### Getting Started Guide
1. **Download & Open** — When you first open Saint Match, you'll see a brief onboarding that explains how the app works. No account creation is required — you can start immediately.
2. **Choose Your Mood** — On the Home screen, you'll see six mood options: Seeking Peace, Need Focus, Want to Grow, Feeling Grateful, Full of Joy, and Ready to Serve. Tap the one that best describes how you're feeling right now.
3. **Meet Your Saint** — Our AI will match you with a Catholic saint who embodies the virtue you need. Read about their life and the specific connection to your mood.
4. **Accept Your Challenge** — Each match comes with a micro-challenge — a simple, practical action you can complete in 5–15 minutes. Tap "Accept Challenge" to commit.
5. **Complete & Celebrate** — When you finish your challenge, mark it complete. You'll earn a streak day and see your progress grow in your Virtue Portfolio.
6. **Build Your Streak** — Come back daily to keep your streak alive. The app sends a gentle reminder at 8:30 AM and a streak alert at 8:00 PM.

### Feature Explanations
- **Mood Selection:** Six moods spanning support needs (Seeking Peace, Need Focus, Want to Grow) and growth celebrations (Feeling Grateful, Full of Joy, Ready to Serve). Each maps to specific saints and virtues.
- **AI Saint Matching:** Powered by Claude AI (via secure server-side processing), each match considers your mood and pairs you with a relevant saint and a tailored micro-challenge. Free users get 3 matches per week; Pro users get unlimited.
- **Streak Tracking:** Your streak counts consecutive days of completed challenges. A calendar view shows your history. Pro users get one free streak freeze per week in case you miss a day.
- **Virtue Portfolio:** Tracks all your completed challenges, the virtues you've practiced, and your weekly patience self-assessment scores. You can export your full history as a JSON file to share with a spiritual director.
- **Novenas:** Guided 9-day prayer journeys with saints like St. Benedict, St. Thérèse, St. Francis de Sales, and St. Monica. Set a personal intention, pray daily, and optionally receive AI-personalized prayers.
- **Account Linking:** The app works anonymously by default. You can optionally link an email address in Settings to sync your data across devices.

### Troubleshooting

1. **I can't log in or my data disappeared**
   Saint Match uses anonymous accounts by default — your data is stored on your device. If you reinstalled the app or switched devices, your local data may be lost. To prevent this, go to Settings → Link Account and add your email for cloud sync. If you previously linked an email, your data should restore automatically.

2. **My saint match isn't loading / "Something went wrong"**
   This usually means the AI service is temporarily unavailable or you're offline. The app will automatically fall back to matching you with a saint from our built-in library. Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists, force-close and reopen the app.

3. **I hit my weekly match limit**
   Free users get 3 saint matches per week. Your limit resets every Monday. To get unlimited daily matches, upgrade to Saint Match Pro from the prompt that appears or from Settings.

4. **My streak reset unexpectedly**
   Streaks reset if more than one day passes without completing a challenge. Pro users get one streak freeze per week that automatically activates if you miss a day. Check the Calendar tab to see your completion history.

5. **Notifications aren't working**
   Make sure notifications are enabled for Saint Match in your device's Settings. The app sends a daily reminder at 8:30 AM and a streak protection alert at 8:00 PM. You can manage notification preferences in the app's Settings screen.

6. **Payment or subscription issues**
   Subscriptions are managed through the App Store (iOS). To check your subscription status, go to your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions. To cancel, manage it there — we cannot cancel subscriptions on our end. If you purchased Pro but it's not showing, tap "Restore Purchases" on the upgrade screen.

7. **The app is slow or crashing**
   Try force-closing and reopening the app. Make sure you're running the latest version from the App Store. If the issue persists, go to Settings → Export My Data (to back up your data), then delete and reinstall the app.

### FAQ

1. **Is Saint Match a Catholic app?**
   Yes! Saint Match is built by Catholics for Catholics. All saints, prayers, and challenges are rooted in the Catholic tradition. The app is designed to complement your prayer life, not replace it.

2. **Do I need to create an account?**
   No. Saint Match works immediately with an anonymous account. Your data is stored securely on your device. You can optionally link an email in Settings for cross-device sync and backup.

3. **How does the AI matching work?**
   When you select your mood, our AI (powered by Anthropic's Claude, processed securely on our servers — never on your device) considers your emotional state and matches you with a saint whose life and virtues speak to your situation. Each match includes a unique micro-challenge. Your data is never used to train AI models.

4. **What's included in the free version?**
   Free users get 3 saint matches per week, daily streak tracking, a basic Virtue Portfolio, and access to curated novenas. That's plenty to build a meaningful daily practice.

5. **What does Pro include?**
   Pro ($7.99/mo or $79/yr) unlocks unlimited daily matches, full Virtue Portfolio analytics, weekly streak freeze protection, PDF export for spiritual directors, and AI-personalized novena prayers.

6. **Can I use Saint Match offline?**
   Yes! The app works fully offline using locally stored saint data. AI-powered matches require an internet connection, but if you're offline, the app will match you with a saint from the built-in library.

7. **How do novenas work in the app?**
   Choose from guided 9-day novenas with saints like St. Benedict, St. Thérèse, St. Francis de Sales, and St. Monica. Set a personal intention, read the daily prayer, and track your progress. Pro users can receive AI-personalized prayers tailored to their intention.

8. **Is my data private and secure?**
   Absolutely. Your data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced to our secure cloud (powered by Supabase with row-level security). We never sell your data or use it for advertising. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for full details.

## Global Design Notes for Lovable

- **Use the exact color palette above** — sage green `#7A8F70` for primary actions and accents, terracotta `#C96B55` for CTAs and highlights, warm cream `#F5F1EA` for backgrounds.
- All pages should share a **consistent header/navbar** with the Saint Match logo/wordmark, and navigation links (Home, Support, Terms, Privacy).
- Mobile-responsive design is essential.
- Use subtle background textures or gradients (cream to warm white) — avoid stark white.
- Section transitions should feel smooth — consider subtle dividers or gradient fades between sections.
- Keep the overall tone **warm, inviting, and reverent** — this is a Catholic devotional app, not a generic SaaS product.
- CTA buttons should use the terracotta color with rounded corners and a subtle hover state.
- Legal pages (Terms, Privacy) should be clean and well-organized with a table of contents or anchor links for long sections.
- The Support page should feel helpful and human, not corporate.
